# Gold Recovery Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting gold recovery efficiency using data from various stages of ore processing and purification. The goal was to assist the industrial analytics company Zyfra in improving production output, reducing waste, and supporting data-driven decisions in gold extraction.

## Objectives

- Preprocess and align time-series data from multiple processing stages  
- Build regression models to predict final gold recovery rates  
- Identify influential features across the flotation, rougher, and cleaner stages  
- Evaluate model accuracy and robustness for deployment readiness

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Approach

- Cleaned and synchronized data from different process stages  
- Handled missing values, irrelevant features, and time-lag alignment  
- Performed exploratory analysis and visualizations  
- Trained regression models including Linear Regression and Random Forest  
- Evaluated results using RMSE and business-defined performance criteria

## Key Insights

- Certain chemical concentrations and process inputs had strong influence on recovery outcomes  
- Model predictions aligned closely with actual recovery rates in test sets  
- Insights could help Zyfra reduce resource loss and optimize production workflows
